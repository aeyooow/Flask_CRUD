Activity: Building a CRUD REST API with MySQL, Testing, and XML/JSON Output

In this hands-on activity, you will be creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API for your chosen MySQL database (from
our recent activity). The API will allow users to interact with the database and will act as an Interface to any client that understands
JSON or XML. You will also set up tests to ensure the functionality of the API, and provide the option to format the API output as XML
or JSON.
